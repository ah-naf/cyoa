# Dynamic HTML Story Renderer

A Go project that dynamically renders a **"Choose Your Adventure"-style story** using HTML templates. The story is defined in JSON format, and users can navigate through different arcs using links displayed on the web interface.

## Features

- **HTML Templates**: Uses Go's `html/template` package for dynamic web content generation.
- **User Interaction**: Provides clickable links to navigate through story arcs.
- **Flexible Story Input**: Stories are defined in JSON format, making them easy to extend or modify.
- **Lightweight Web Server**: A simple Go HTTP server powers the application.

  "intro": {
    "title": "The Mysterious Envelope",
    "story": [
      "You find a black envelope under your door...",
      "Inside is a cryptic note warning you of danger."
    ],
    "options": [
      { "text": "Call the police", "arc": "call-police" },
      { "text": "Investigate on your own", "arc": "solo-investigation" }
    ]
  },
  "call-police": {
    "title": "Calling the Police",
    "story": [
